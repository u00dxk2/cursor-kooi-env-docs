### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Help us fix it!

**Before submitting a bug report:**
- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Try the latest version to see if it's already fixed
- Gather as much detail as possible about the problem

**When submitting a bug report, include:**
- **Clear title**: Descriptive one-liner
- **Environment**: OS, shell (PowerShell/Bash/Zsh), version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Exact commands you ran
- **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happened
- **Screenshots/logs**: If applicable
- **Additional context**: Anything else that might help

**Example:**
```markdown
## Bug: Check script fails on macOS with BSD date

**Environment:**
- OS: macOS 14.2 (Sonoma)
- Shell: Zsh 5.9

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Install using `curl -fsSL ... | bash`
2. Run `./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh`

**Expected:** Script shows staleness status
**Actual:** Error: "date: illegal option -- -"

**Cause:** BSD date vs GNU date syntax difference
```

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea for improvement?

**Before suggesting a feature:**
- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/issues) for similar suggestions
- Consider if it fits the project's scope (environment documentation for AI assistants)
- Think about how it would work across different platforms

**When suggesting a feature, include:**
- **Use case**: What problem does it solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives**: Other ways you considered
- **Examples**: How other tools handle this
- **Breaking changes**: Would this affect existing users?

### Adding Examples

One of the most valuable contributions! We need examples for various tech stacks.

**Good examples to add:**
- Different programming languages (Ruby, Go, Java, C#, etc.)
- Different frameworks (Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot, ASP.NET, etc.)
- Different project types (mobile apps, CLI tools, libraries, etc.)
- Unique environments (Docker, WSL, remote development, etc.)

**Example structure:**
```
examples/[framework-name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-environment.md  # Complete, realistic example
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quick-prompt.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ check-env-docs.sh
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ check-env-docs.ps1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ environment-maintenance.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                        # Minimal working code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [config files]              # package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Explains the example
```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Shell Scripts (Bash/PowerShell)

**General principles:**
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide user-friendly output
- Test on multiple platforms

**Bash example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on error

# Colors for output
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
NC='\033[0m'

# Check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}Error: File not found${NC}"
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "${GREEN}Success!${NC}"
```

**PowerShell example:**
```powershell
# Use approved verbs
function Test-Installation {
    param($Path)
    
    if (-not (Test-Path $Path)) {
        Write-Host "Error: Path not found" -ForegroundColor Red
        return $false
    }
    
    Write-Host "Success!" -ForegroundColor Green
    return $true
}
```

### Markdown Documentation

- Use clear headings (H1 for title, H2 for sections)
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üöÄ, etc.)
- Keep line length reasonable (~120 chars max)
- Use code blocks with language specified
- Add links to related documentation

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description if needed. Explain WHY, not just WHAT.

Closes #123
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(installer): add support for custom installation directory
fix(check-script): handle missing date command on minimal systems
docs(readme): add troubleshooting section for PowerShell execution policy
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

**Installer testing:**
```bash
# Test fresh install
cd /tmp/test-project-1
git init
bash /path/to/install.sh

# Test with existing .cursor/
cd /tmp/test-project-2
mkdir .cursor
bash /path/to/install.sh

# Test without git
cd /tmp/test-project-3
bash /path/to/install.sh  # Should warn but allow continuation
```

**Check script testing:**
```bash
# Test current status (< 7 days)
# Manually set date to today in project-environment.md
./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh

# Test warning status (7-13 days)
# Set date to 10 days ago
./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh

# Test critical status (14+ days)
# Set date to 20 days ago
./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh

# Test missing file
rm .cursor/project-environment.md
./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh
```

### Automated Testing (Future)

We're working on automated tests. If you can help with this, it's very welcome!
