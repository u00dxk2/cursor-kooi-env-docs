# Cursor Environment Docs 📚

> Auto-updating environment documentation that keeps Cursor smart about your project.

Stop wasting time explaining your environment setup to Cursor in every conversation. This system automatically maintains fresh documentation about your development environment, ensuring Cursor always has the context it needs.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Auto-updating**: AI checks every conversation, updates in real-time as you develop
- 📝 **Self-documenting**: Captures gotchas and mistakes automatically
- 🔄 **Cross-session**: Works across all Cursor conversations
- ⚡ **5-minute setup**: One command to install, minimal configuration
- 🔍 **Staleness checker**: Know when your docs need attention
- 🎯 **Framework agnostic**: Works with any tech stack
- 💾 **Git-friendly**: Version-controlled documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Line Install

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> **Security Note:** The installer downloads and runs scripts from GitHub. You can [review the installer script](https://github.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/blob/main/install.sh) before running. It only creates a `.cursor/` directory in your current project—no system-level changes, no admin/root privileges required.

> **⚠️ Existing .cursor/ Setup:** The installer **preserves existing files** by default. If you have an existing `.cursor/` directory, only missing files will be added. To overwrite everything (clean reinstall), download the installer and run with `--force` flag:
> ```bash
> # Unix/Mac
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/main/install.sh -o install.sh
> bash install.sh --force
> 
> # Windows
> irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
> .\install.ps1 --force
> ```

### What It Does

1. Creates `.cursor/` directory in your project
2. Installs template files and AI rules
3. Sets up automatic documentation maintenance
4. Provides a staleness checker script

### Next Steps

After installation:

1. Open your project with an AI assistant
2. Ask it to create the environment documentation:
   ```
   Create .cursor/project-environment.md following the template in .cursor/quick-prompt.txt
   ```
3. Commit the files:
   ```bash
   git add .cursor/
   git commit -m "feat: Add environment documentation system"
   git push
   ```

**Important:** Commit the entire `.cursor/` directory! This is shared project documentation, not personal IDE settings. Your team needs these files.

**Done!** 🎉 Your AI assistants will now have consistent, up-to-date context about your project.

## 🎯 Why You Need This

### The Problem

Working with AI assistants, you often encounter:
- ❌ Wasting time explaining the same environment details repeatedly
- ❌ AI suggesting commands that don't work in your shell (PowerShell vs Bash)
- ❌ Hitting the same environment gotchas across multiple sessions
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior between different AI conversations
- ❌ Documentation that gets stale and out of sync

### The Solution

This system:
- ✅ Documents your environment once, benefits forever
- ✅ AI automatically reads it at session start
- ✅ Self-updates when environment changes
- ✅ Captures mistakes so you never repeat them
- ✅ Works with any AI coding assistant
- ✅ Stays fresh with automatic staleness checking

## 📊 What Gets Documented

The system captures:

- **Directory Structure**: Absolute paths, workspace layout
- **Shell Environment**: PowerShell vs Bash syntax differences
- **Common Commands**: Git workflow, package managers, build/test commands
- **Tech Stack**: Framework versions, dependencies, external services
- **Environment Gotchas**: Mistakes to avoid, path issues, quirks
- **Development Workflow**: How to start dev server, run tests, deploy

## 🔄 How It Stays Current

### Automatic Updates (The Smart Way)

**Every new Cursor conversation:**
1. ✅ AI reads `.cursor/project-environment.md` immediately
2. ✅ Checks "Last Updated" date automatically
3. ✅ Offers to review and update if stale

**During development:**
- ✅ AI updates **in real-time** when discovering changes:
  - New dependencies installed
  - Command syntax issues found
  - Environment gotchas discovered
  - Tech stack changes

**Staleness thresholds** (safety net for busy projects):
- **< 7 days**: Current, no action needed
- **7-14 days**: Review recommended
- **14+ days**: Update strongly recommended

### Manual Check

Want to check staleness yourself? Run anytime:
```bash
# Unix/Mac
./.cursor/check-env-docs.sh

# Windows
.\.cursor\check-env-docs.ps1
```

## 📁 File Structure

After installation, your project will have:

```
your-project/
└── .cursor/
    ├── project-environment.md      # Your project's environment docs (AI-generated)
    ├── quick-prompt.txt            # Template for AI to use
    ├── check-env-docs.sh/.ps1      # Staleness checker
    ├── README.md                   # System overview
    └── rules/
        └── environment-maintenance.mdc  # AI behavior rules
```

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

**Multi-platform teams?** No problem! The `.cursor/project-environment.md` file should document ALL team members' platforms:

```markdown
## Shell Environment

**Team Setup:**
- Windows developers: PowerShell 7+
- macOS developers: Zsh (default)
- Linux developers: Bash

## Common Commands

### Start Dev Server

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

**Bash/Zsh:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
```

**Key principles:**
- 📚 **One document, all platforms** - Don't overwrite, add alongside
- 🏷️ **Label everything** - Make platform requirements explicit  
- ➕ **Add, don't replace** - Each platform's commands coexist
- 💬 **Document gotchas** - Platform differences help everyone

See [docs/TEAM-COLLABORATION.md](./docs/TEAM-COLLABORATION.md) for complete guide.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Setup** (once): Run installer in your project
2. **Generate** (once): Have AI create project-environment.md
3. **Use**: AI automatically reads it in every session
4. **Update**: AI offers to update when stale

### How Cursor Uses It

**Automatic Integration:**
- Cursor automatically reads `.cursor/` directory at session start
- AI checks "Last Updated" date and offers to update if stale
- Maintenance rules are automatically applied
- No manual work required - it just works!

**Using with Other AI Tools:**
While designed for Cursor, you can manually share the `project-environment.md` file with other AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), but automatic date checking and maintenance won't work.

### Validation

Verify your installation is correct:

```bash
# Unix/Mac
./.cursor/validate-install.sh

# Windows
.\.cursor\validate-install.ps1
```

This checks:
- All required files exist
- Documentation format is correct
- Git integration is working
- Scripts are executable

### Customization

Edit `.cursor/project-environment.md` to:
- Change review frequency (default: 7 days)
- Add project-specific sections
- Document unique gotchas
- Add team-specific conventions

See the [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) for common customization questions.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Born from real frustrations with AI pair programming workflows in [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).

**Note:** This tool is specifically designed for Cursor, which automatically reads the `.cursor/` directory and applies maintenance rules. While you can manually share the documentation with other AI assistants, the automatic update system is Cursor-specific.
