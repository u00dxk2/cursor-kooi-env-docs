## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed
- **Installer messaging clarity** ([#2](https://github.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/pull/2)): Changed "Installation complete!" to "Template files installed successfully!" to prevent users from thinking they're done when they still need to create `project-environment.mdc`
- **Git commit guidance**: Added explicit warnings in installers, quick-prompt.txt, and template README to prevent confusion about committing the `.cursor/` directory
  - Fixed ambiguous wording that led AI agents to suggest gitignoring `.cursor/` or treating it as partially tracked
  - Now explicitly states: "Commit the ENTIRE .cursor/ directory to Git. Do NOT add it to .gitignore."

### Changed
- Installer success message is now more accurate about completion status
- Git commit instructions emphasize committing ALL `.cursor/` files, not just `project-environment.mdc`
