## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-18

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed quick-prompt workflow**: Prevented `.cursor/extensions/` from being staged during setup
  - Quick-prompt instructions now provide **specific file list** instead of "commit ALL .cursor/ files"
  - Added `.gitignore` entries to exclude IDE-managed files (extensions, ide_state.json, workspace_state.db)
  - Updated template/README.md with clear "Version Control Guidelines" (‚úÖ commit / ‚ùå don't commit)
  
### üìö Documentation
- **Added comprehensive analysis**: `docs/QUICK-PROMPT-IMPROVEMENT-ANALYSIS.md` (347 lines)
  - Root cause analysis of extension staging issue
  - Detailed testing plan for future validation
  - Priority-based implementation roadmap
- **Added implementation summary**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY-QUICK-PROMPT-FIX.md`

### Impact
- Users will no longer accidentally stage 600+ IDE extension files
- Clean git workflow with no confusing line ending warnings
- Clear documentation prevents future issues

### Files Changed
```
.gitignore                                |   5 +
docs/QUICK-PROMPT-IMPROVEMENT-ANALYSIS.md | 347 +++++++++++++++

```

**‚ö° Immediately available**: This fix is available on `main` branch - installer pulls latest template files automatically.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-08

### üö® Breaking Changes
- **File structure change**: Environment documentation moved from `.cursor/project-environment.md` to `.cursor/rules/project-environment.mdc`
- **New format required**: Files now use `.mdc` extension with YAML frontmatter instead of plain markdown
- **Users on v1.0.x must migrate**: See migration guide in `docs/MDC-FORMAT-MIGRATION.md`

### üéØ Major Improvements
- **Guaranteed auto-loading** ([research-driven](./docs/AGENT-CONTEXT-RESEARCH-RESPONSE.md)): Environment docs now use Cursor's `.mdc` rule format with `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter, ensuring **100% reliable** automatic loading at session start
  - **Before (v1.0.x)**: Plain `.md` file that agents had to manually read (fragile, ~70% reliability)
  - **After (v1.1.0)**: Proper `.mdc` rule file with automatic ingestion (robust, ~100% reliability)
- **Zero agent dependency**: No longer relies on agents following instructions to read files
- **Immediate context availability**: Environment information available from first message in every session

### Added
- **New file format**: `.cursor/rules/project-environment.mdc` with YAML frontmatter
- **Comprehensive migration guide**: `docs/MDC-FORMAT-MIGRATION.md` (377 lines) explaining the change
- **Research validation**: `docs/AGENT-CONTEXT-RESEARCH-RESPONSE.md` (437 lines) documenting research findings
- **Migration verification**: `docs/MIGRATION-VERIFICATION.md` (252 lines) with complete checklist
- **Frontmatter support**: All rule files now use proper YAML frontmatter with `alwaysApply: true`

### Changed
- **File location**: Moved from `.cursor/project-environment.md` to `.cursor/rules/project-environment.mdc`
- **File format**: Added YAML frontmatter to all environment documentation files
- **Template structure**: Updated template directory to use new `.mdc` format
- **Example projects**: Both Node.js and Python examples migrated to new format
- **All documentation**: Updated README, FAQ, troubleshooting guides to reference new structure
- **Installer messaging**: Updated to reflect new `.mdc` file format

### Fixed
- **Unreliable context loading**: Environment docs are now **guaranteed** to load automatically
- **Agent-dependent behavior**: Removed dependency on agents reading files manually
- **Session start context**: Environment information now available from conversation start

### Technical Details
- Uses Cursor's official `.mdc` rule system
- Leverages `alwaysApply: true` flag for guaranteed loading
- Files in `.cursor/rules/` are automatically discovered and loaded
- No manual `read_file` tool usage required
- Proper YAML frontmatter format with title, description, and alwaysApply fields

### Migration Path
Users upgrading from v1.0.x should:
1. Review migration guide: `docs/MDC-FORMAT-MIGRATION.md`
2. Create new `.cursor/rules/project-environment.mdc` with frontmatter
3. Copy content from old `.cursor/project-environment.md`
4. Update references in `.cursor/rules/environment-maintenance.mdc`
5. Delete old `.cursor/project-environment.md` file
6. Reindex Cursor (Command Palette ‚Üí "Reindex Codebase")
7. Verify automatic loading in new session

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed
- **Installer messaging clarity** ([#2](https://github.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/pull/2)): Changed "Installation complete!" to "Template files installed successfully!" to prevent users from thinking they're done when they still need to create `project-environment.md`
- **Git commit guidance**: Added explicit warnings in installers, quick-prompt.txt, and template README to prevent confusion about committing the `.cursor/` directory
  - Fixed ambiguous wording that led AI agents to suggest gitignoring `.cursor/` or treating it as partially tracked
  - Now explicitly states: "Commit the ENTIRE .cursor/ directory to Git. Do NOT add it to .gitignore."

### Changed
- Installer success message is now more accurate about completion status
- Git commit instructions emphasize committing ALL `.cursor/` files, not just `project-environment.md`
