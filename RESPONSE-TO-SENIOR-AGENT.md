# Response to Senior Agent Questions

## 1. Research Sources to Prioritize

**Primary Sources (High Priority):**
- **Official Cursor documentation** - Any official guidance on `.cursor/` directory usage
- **Cursor's GitHub discussions/issues** - Real user problems and solutions
- **Security best practices for devtool scripts** - Especially around:
  - Downloading and executing scripts from GitHub
  - PowerShell execution policies
  - Bash script security
  - Supply chain security for installers

**Secondary Sources (Medium Priority):**
- **Similar tools for other AI coding assistants** - Learn from:
  - GitHub Copilot workspace configurations
  - VSCode extension patterns
  - Other AI assistant memory/context systems
- **Developer tool distribution best practices** - How do others handle:
  - Cross-platform installation
  - Version management
  - Update mechanisms
- **Documentation system comparisons** - Tools like:
  - Docusaurus
  - Readme generators
  - Environment documentation tools

**Tertiary Sources (Nice to Have):**
- **Blog posts from trusted devs** about AI pair programming workflows
- **Reddit/HN discussions** about Cursor usage patterns
- **Twitter/X threads** from Cursor power users

## 2. Suggestion Grouping

**Please group by PRIORITY** with subcategories:

### Priority Structure We Need:

**P0 - Blocking Launch:**
- Critical security issues
- Fundamental architecture flaws
- Must-fix bugs that break core functionality
- Legal/licensing issues

**P1 - Should Fix Before Launch:**
- Significant UX issues
- Important security improvements
- Missing critical documentation
- Features that competitors have

**P2 - Should Fix Soon (v1.1.0):**
- Nice-to-have UX improvements
- Additional features
- Enhanced documentation
- Community-requested items

**P3 - Future Enhancements (v2.0+):**
- Advanced features
- Experimental ideas
- Long-term vision items

**Within each priority level, please tag by theme:**
- üîí Security
- üë§ UX/User Experience
- üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- üìö Documentation
- üöÄ Performance
- ü§ù Community/Collaboration

**Example format we'd like:**
```
## P0 - Blocking Launch

### üîí Security: Script Download Verification
**Issue:** Installers download scripts without checksum verification
**Risk:** Supply chain attack vector
**Recommendation:** Add SHA-256 checksums
**Effort:** 2-4 hours
```

## 3. Constraints to Respect

### Hard Constraints (MUST respect):

1. **Cursor-Native Only**
   - Must use `.cursor/` directory (Cursor's convention)
   - Cannot require external dependencies beyond Cursor itself
   - System must work with Cursor's automatic file reading

2. **No External Dependencies**
   - Bash/PowerShell/Zsh only (system shells)
   - No npm/pip/cargo/etc. required for core functionality
   - Pure markdown for documentation (no build step)

3. **Cross-Platform**
   - Must work on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - PowerShell AND Bash support required
   - Cannot require admin/root privileges for normal operation

4. **Git-Friendly**
   - Must work in version-controlled projects
   - Files should be plain text (diffable, mergeable)
   - No binary files or compiled artifacts

5. **5-Minute Setup**
   - Installation must be quick and simple
   - One-line install command required
   - Minimal configuration needed

### Soft Constraints (prefer but flexible):

1. **Simplicity Over Features**
   - Prefer doing one thing well
   - Avoid feature creep
   - Keep it understandable for non-experts

2. **No Build Step**
   - Prefer static files over generated ones
   - Avoid requiring toolchains (webpack, etc.)
   - Keep it accessible

3. **Community Contributions**
   - Make it easy for others to contribute examples
   - Clear contribution path
   - Low barrier to entry

### Out of Scope (don't suggest):

- ‚ùå NPM package (may consider for v2.0, but not now)
- ‚ùå VSCode extension (different IDE)
- ‚ùå Web dashboard/GUI (keep it simple)
- ‚ùå Database/backend requirements
- ‚ùå Paid/premium features (open source only)
- ‚ùå Support for other AI tools beyond Cursor (validated decision)

## 4. Specific Areas We'd Love Your Focus

### Critical Questions for You:

1. **Security Review** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Are our installers safe?
   - Should we sign releases?
   - Any attack vectors we missed?
   - What about the `.mdc` rule files - any risks?

2. **Architecture Validation**
   - Is the `.cursor/` directory structure optimal?
   - Should we use YAML/JSON instead of markdown?
   - Are we missing any critical files?
   - Is the maintenance rule approach sound?

3. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Do similar tools exist we should learn from?
   - What are we doing better/worse?
   - Any gaps in our feature set?

4. **Version Management Strategy**
   - Installers currently download from `main` branch (we know this is bad)
   - What's the best approach for tagged releases?
   - How do we handle updates to installed systems?

5. **User Experience**
   - Would a first-time user succeed?
   - Any confusing parts?
   - Missing documentation?
   - Better onboarding flow?

6. **Community Readiness**
   - Are we ready for open source community?
   - What will people complain about?
   - How can we make it easier to contribute?

## 5. What We Already Know Needs Work

**(So you can focus on what we haven't identified):**

- ‚ùå Need to create v1.0.0 release tag
- ‚ùå Need to update installer URLs to use tags
- ‚ùå No automated testing yet
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline
- ‚ùå Haven't tested on fresh systems yet
- ‚ùå Only 2 framework examples (want more)

## 6. Decision Framework

**When making recommendations, please consider:**

1. **Launch Timeline** - We want to launch in 2-4 days
   - P0/P1 items could delay launch
   - P2/P3 can be deferred

2. **Effort vs. Impact**
   - High impact, low effort = do immediately
   - High impact, high effort = schedule for v1.1
   - Low impact = defer or reject

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Security issues = fix immediately
   - UX issues = depends on severity
   - Nice-to-haves = defer

4. **Community Expectations**
   - What will users expect?
   - What will disappoint them?
   - What will delight them?

## 7. Output Format We'd Like

### Executive Summary
- 3-5 sentence overall assessment
- Go/no-go recommendation
- Critical blockers if any

### Detailed Findings
- Organized by priority (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Tagged by theme
- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Effort estimates where possible

### Competitive Analysis
- What similar tools exist?
- What can we learn from them?
- Our differentiators

### Security Assessment
- Specific vulnerabilities found
- Risk level for each
- Mitigation recommendations

### Launch Readiness
- Your assessment of 95% ready claim
- What percentage would you give?
- Required items before launch

## 8. Final Notes

- **Be brutally honest** - we want critical analysis, not cheerleading
- **Think like a user** - would you actually use this?
- **Think like a maintainer** - will this become a burden?
- **Think like a security researcher** - can this be exploited?
- **Don't hold back** - better to find issues now than after launch

We trust your expertise and want your unvarnished opinion. If you think we should delay launch, say so. If you think something is fundamentally flawed, tell us. We'd rather hear it now from you than later from users (or attackers).
