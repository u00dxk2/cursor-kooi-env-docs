## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Weaknesses & Concerns

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Cursor-Specific Lock-In
**Issue:** Entirely dependent on Cursor's `.cursor/` directory convention  
**Risk:** If Cursor changes this, system breaks  
**Mitigation:** Document clearly as Cursor-specific  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already addressed in documentation

#### 2. No Automated Testing
**Issue:** No tests for installers or scripts  
**Risk:** Breaking changes could go unnoticed  
**Impact:** Medium - manual testing required  
**Recommendation:** Add basic smoke tests before v1.0.0

#### 3. No CI/CD Pipeline
**Issue:** No GitHub Actions for testing  
**Risk:** Quality regression over time  
**Impact:** Low for initial launch, higher for long-term  
**Recommendation:** Can defer to v1.1.0

#### 4. Single Point of Maintenance
**Issue:** Project has one maintainer (you)  
**Risk:** Bus factor of 1  
**Impact:** Long-term sustainability concern  
**Recommendation:** Build community contributors

### Design Concerns

#### 5. Installer Downloads from `main` Branch
**Issue:** Not using tagged releases  
**Risk:** Breaking changes could break installations  
**Impact:** HIGH - must fix before launch  
**Recommendation:** Create v1.0.0 tag, update installer URLs

#### 6. No Uninstaller
**Issue:** Users must manually delete `.cursor/` directory  
**Impact:** Low - deletion is simple  
**Recommendation:** Nice-to-have for future

#### 7. No Configuration File
**Issue:** Review frequency (7 days) is hardcoded  
**Impact:** Low - most users will use default  
**Recommendation:** Future enhancement

#### 8. Limited Framework Examples
**Issue:** Only 2 examples (Node.js, Python)  
**Impact:** Medium - users with other stacks lack reference  
**Recommendation:** Community can contribute more

### Documentation Concerns

#### 9. No Video Tutorial
**Issue:** Text-only documentation  
**Impact:** Low - docs are comprehensive  
**Recommendation:** Future nice-to-have

#### 10. No Performance Considerations
**Issue:** Docs don't mention file size limits  
**Impact:** Low - markdown files are tiny  
**Recommendation:** Not urgent

### Technical Debt

#### 11. Scripts Have Minimal Error Handling
**Issue:** Download failures could leave partial installations  
**Impact:** Medium - confuses users  
**Status:** Partially addressed  
**Recommendation:** Add rollback mechanism

#### 12. No Update Mechanism
**Issue:** No way to update installed files if bugs found  
**Impact:** Medium - users must manually reinstall  
**Recommendation:** Add `update` command in future

#### 13. Git Strategy Confusion (FULLY RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Users might think `.cursor/` should be in `.gitignore` (like personal IDE settings)  
**Reality:** Our `.cursor/` is **shared project documentation**, not personal settings  
**Impact:** Medium - users might not commit it, breaking team sharing  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED - Comprehensive documentation added and pushed to GitHub  
**Documentation Added:**
- FAQ: Dedicated "Should I commit .cursor/ to git?" section with detailed explanation
- README: Bold warning to commit the entire directory
- TROUBLESHOOTING: Prominent "Do NOT add .cursor/ to .gitignore!" section with examples
- MESSAGE-TO-OTHER-AGENT.md: Template message explaining the issue to team members

**Key Point:** Entire `.cursor/` directory should be committed to git - now extensively documented
