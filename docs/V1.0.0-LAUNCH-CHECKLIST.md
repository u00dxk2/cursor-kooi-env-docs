## 5. üß™ Test the Release

**Action:** Verify v1.0.0 installation works from the tag

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create a temporary test directory
cd ..
mkdir v1.0.0-test
cd v1.0.0-test
git init

# Test the installation FROM the v1.0.0 tag
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/u00dxk2/cursor-kooi-env-docs/v1.0.0/install.ps1 | iex

# Verify files were installed
dir .cursor
```

**Expected:** Should install successfully with all files present

**If this fails:** The v1.0.0 tag URLs don't work yet - may need to wait a minute for GitHub cache
