## 1. Directory Structure

**Project Root:** `[Your project path - e.g., /home/user/my-project or C:\Users\Name\Projects\my-project]`

- Document absolute paths relevant to your project
- Note path format (Unix slashes vs Windows backslashes)
- Include important subdirectories

**Example:**
```
project-root/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── .cursor/
└── [other directories]
```

---

## 2. Shell Environment

**Shell Type:** [PowerShell / Bash / Zsh / Other]

### Critical Syntax Differences

Document shell-specific syntax that AI assistants need to know:

**PowerShell Example:**
❌ **DON'T USE:** Bash-style command chaining
```powershell
cd /path && git status  # FAILS in PowerShell
```

✅ **DO USE:** PowerShell semicolon separator
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\project; git status
```

**Bash/Zsh Example:**
✅ **USE:** Standard Unix conventions
```bash
cd /path/to/project && git status
```

### Shell-Specific Tips
- [List any quirks, special requirements, or important notes]
- [Path quoting rules]
- [Environment variable syntax]

---

## 3. Common Commands

Document frequently used commands with correct syntax for YOUR shell:

### Git Workflow
```bash

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

### Package Manager
```bash

```

### Linting/Formatting
