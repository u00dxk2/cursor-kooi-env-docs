Please create a `.cursor/project-environment.md` file documenting this development environment. Include:

1. **Directory Structure** - Absolute project root path and path format (Windows/Unix)

2. **Shell Environment** - Shell type for YOU (PowerShell/Bash/Zsh) and critical syntax differences
   - If this is a team project with multiple platforms, document ALL platforms
   - Example: "Team uses: Windows (PowerShell), macOS (Zsh), Linux (Bash)"
   - Show examples of commands that fail vs work (e.g., `&&` vs `;` in PowerShell)
   
3. **Common Commands** - Git workflow, package manager, build/test/dev commands
   - For single-platform projects: Use correct syntax for your shell
   - For multi-platform teams: Document commands for ALL team platforms side-by-side
   - Label each: "PowerShell:", "Bash/Zsh:", or "All Platforms:"

4. **Tech Stack** - Framework, language versions, key dependencies, databases, external APIs

5. **Environment Gotchas** - Mistakes to avoid, line endings, path issues, quirks you've encountered

6. **Development Workflow** - How to start dev server, run tests, build, lint/format

Optional: API keys needed (no values!), external services, IDE recommendations, links to other `.cursor/rules/` docs

Use ‚úÖ/‚ùå to show correct vs incorrect approaches. Keep it concise but practical.
